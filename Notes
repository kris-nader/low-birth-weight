Initial Intuitions:

-Look at literature to further understand which covariates might be important, which are good candidates for interaction terms. 
  - Note: the assignment does confirm that "variables identified in the code sheet given in the table have been shown to be associated
with low birth weight in the obstetrical literature.". It is our task to determine which are significant in THIS population/dataset...
  
- Is FTV categorical or continuous?????? 
 
- Consider running chi-square/anova and/or correlation tests to see which variables/interaction terms are most likely to be part of the best model
  - This might help narrow down the list of potential models we would want to explore (2^4 possible models with just main effects.. even more with interactions included)

-‘Physician visits’ might be a good candidate for interaction term
  - i.e. for age: reason to believe that within certain age groups (i.e. very young or very old), more physician visits would be more beneficial

- Use graphs for visualization purposes and to support our decisions


Problems

1. Should the 'FTV' variable be considered continuous or categorical //should be considered continuous - Still open for discussion

2. We need to consider the difference between association, interaction - Find interaction and test for association

3. How do we determine which models to assess and compare? 

4. Supporting literature
