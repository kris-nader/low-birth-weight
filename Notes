Initial Intuitions:

-Look at literature to further understand which covariates might be important, which are good candidates for interaction terms. 
  - Note: the assignment does confirm that "variables identified in the code sheet given in the table have been shown to be associated
with low birth weight in the obstetrical literature.". It is our task to determine which are significant in THIS population/dataset...
  
- Is FTV categorical or continuous?????? 
 
- Consider running chi-square/anova and/or correlation tests to see which variables/interaction terms are most likely to be part of the best model
  - This might help narrow down the list of potential models we would want to explore (2^4 possible models with just main effects.. even more with interactions included)

-‘Physician visits’ might be a good candidate for interaction term
  - i.e. for age: reason to believe that within certain age groups (i.e. very young or very old), more physician visits would be more beneficial

- Use graphs for visualization purposes and to support our decisions


Problems

1. Should the 'FTV' variable be considered continuous or categorical //should be considered continuous - Still open for discussion

2. We need to consider the difference between association, interaction - Find interaction and test for association

3. How do we determine which models to assess and compare? 

4. Supporting literature

HT - looks like it has an effect on BWT but we don't have a lot of datapoints for patient's with HT 
FTV - likewise... we have less data points for higher FTVs so we should maybe consider grouping these together into one term. 
RACE - in the 'full model' Race3 is not significant but Race2 is so we might want to consider grouping Race2 and Race3 together. 

p-values for correlation - need to fully understand what it means. 

GRAPH SELECTION 
- correlation graph - include if we understand p-values
- LOW VS. AGE boxplot - include!! (remove scatter plot because it doesn't add anything) 
- BWT VS. HT boxplot - note the difference in data points but also does look significant (include in model...) 
- ignore PTL and FTV because we are including them in the interactions 
- include RACE 
- UIIIIIIIIIIII STRONG CANDIDATE - include this graph 
- include smoke graph 
- age and ftv - include 
- age and smoke - smoothed graph 
- i missed some here..
- ptl and UI k (don't know what i was going to write here... sorry...)
