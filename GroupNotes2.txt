Recap:
Kristen: Backwards selection using AIC, code included in repo, correlation between AGE & FTV

2 Models:
- Ran on all predictors: AIC = 0.67
- All predictors except BWT: AIC = 0.83

* Predicted using backwards selection; doesn't consider adding the predictor back once it has been removed

Solution: Let's try brute force, BUT using intuition

AGE/FTV: shown that this actually interacts
LWT/FTV: ?
PTL/UI:
